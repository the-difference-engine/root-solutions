              <h2 class="text-color">Use BENEFITS</h2>
              <p>
                Key point: Environmentalists have long understood the value of rewarding positive environmental behaviors or penalizing detrimental behaviors. By attaching benefits and/or disincentives to specific behavioral outcomes, we can catalyze action or help to reinvigorate pre-established goals.
              </p>
              <h3>Utilize outcome-based incentives</h3>
              <p>
                When users are more equipped to design their own path to achieve a goal, consider designing an outcome-based incentive. For example, reward a percent decrease in overall energy use, rather than specifying that the goal must be achieved through a reduction in light use.
              </p>
              <h3>Build off of existing goals and behaviors</h3>
              <p>
                Tie rewards to goals the audience already possesses. For example, the “Cash for Clunkers” program reached many drivers who were considering purchasing a more fuel efficient car in the coming years, but needed a push in the form of a rebate to do so sooner.
              </p>
              <h3>Use penalties wisely</h3>
              <p>
                Harness the audience’s natural aversion to loss through disincentives, but be careful – we will go a long way to avoid loss, so watch out for potential short cuts to circumvent penalties. For example, when imposing a tax on household waste, be sure to account for the unintended behavior of dumping excess trash elsewhere.
              </p>
              <h3>Reward specific behaviors</h3>
              <p>
                When abstract goals are hard to follow through on, it is usually best to reward or penalize a clear-cut behavior that advance our goals. For example, plastic bag taxes at the checkout line reinforce a specific sustainable behavior and encourage consumers to reduce their impact by bringing a reusable bag from home.
              </p>
              <h3>Make benefits and costs immediate</h3>
              <p>
                As practitioners, we want to jumpstart environmental behaviors as efficiently as possible. When developing incentives, play upon the audiences’ tendency to prioritize immediate rewards or costs over those that are faraway by including a stimulus up front.
              </p>
              <h3>Tailor the incentive</h3>
              <p>
                Remember: there is no one “catch all” incentive that works for every occasion. To produce the best incentive, get creative, and make sure to align benefits with the what the audience finds attractive.
              </p>
              <h3>Limit the availability of benefits</h3>
              <p>
                Scarcity of resources plays a big role in motivating behavior. When designing rewards, consider offering a limited-amount or a limited-time reward.
              </p>
              <h3>Optimize resources</h3>
              <p>
                We know that large prizes can entice our audiences.  If we have a finite number of resources to offer, we can reduce the number and increase the value of each reward. For high participation and impact, use a lottery system!
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Easy" class="tab-pane fade h-color">
              <h2 class="text-color">Make it EASY</h2>
              <p>
                Key point: Any kind of barrier to action, whether mental or physical, discourages us from a behavior. Making it easy involves removing barriers to desired actions and erecting barriers to deleterious actions, while employing defaults to promote favorable actions. These strategies together are quite powerful, as they make environmentally friendly behavior virtually effortless.
              </p>
              <h3>Set the stage for easy action</h3>
              <p>
                As practitioners, we need to make sure we are not asking our target groups to make a change without first providing them the appropriate infrastructure with which to do so. For example, if our goal is to decrease plastic water bottle consumption, we should make sure we offer a convenient alternative water source.
              </p>
              <h3>Reduce hassle factors</h3>
              <p>
                When we feel there are too many hoops to jump through in order to achieve a result, we are likely to avoid the action entirely. By limiting the amount of time and effort it takes to do something, we can increase our audiences’ rate of participation and cooperation.
              </p>
              <h3>Reduce choices</h3>
              <p>
                Avoid choice paralysis – the tendency to freeze up when options become too numerous or complex – by limiting the number of actionable environmental options available to the audience.
              </p>
              <h3>Design information to be easy to understand and execute</h3>
              <p>
                We often avoid following through on certain actions because the information we receive is complicated or hard to understand. Make it easy to adopt and sustain the preferred behavior by offering the audience simple, uncluttered information and clear directions on which to act.
              </p>
              <h3>Use choice architecture</h3>
              <p>
                The way in which choices are presented to us plays a huge role in the ultimate decisions we make. Employ choice architecture to subtly nudge your audience toward the preferred behavior. For example, by placing vegetarian options on the front of a menu, restaurants can guide their patrons to choose more environmentally sustainable consumption.
              </p>
              <h3>Make it the default setting</h3>
              <p>
                Doing nothing is the easiest action of all, so by making the environmental action the default, we can seamlessly increase our audience’s support for our effort. Present the desired option as the preselected default and offer the user the opportunity to opt-out. Setting  environmental defaults for routine activities like printing or booking travel tickets can reap huge environmental pay-offs.
              </p>
              <h3>Erect barriers to undesirable actions</h3>
              <p>
                As practitioners, we can use the tendency to avoid taking actions that appear to require too much effort to our advantage by making environmentally inefficient behavior harder to perform. Consider this: if an office is hoping to cut its paper consumption, they might create an effective barrier by moving the office printer to a less convenient location.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Hopeful" class="tab-pane fade h-color">
              <h2 class="text-color">Emphasize HOPEFULNESS</h2>
              <p>
                Key point: Hopelessness leads to avoidance and inaction. In order to feel motivated, we need to be confident that we have the ability to positively affect our planet and that our efforts actually make a difference.
              </p>
              <h3>Highlight successes</h3>
              <p>
                To challenge the notion that environmental problems are beyond repair, show the audience that there are concrete solutions and highlight what is currently being done to mitigate the issue. This way, we can get people to feel that the solution already has some forward momentum, and that they have the power to add to it.
              </p>
              <h3>Use doomsday language sparingly</h3>
              <p>
                While fear-inducing images and large-scale doomsday narratives can effectively capture attention, they can also cause us to feel hopeless and retreat from the issue at hand. Enhance the audience’s sense of self efficacy by pairing threatening messages with clear-cut solutions the audience can implement immediately.
              </p>
              <h3>Offer appropriately scaled solutions</h3>
              <p>
                Frame the problem commensurately to the solution. People primed to think about a large-scale problem won’t be receptive to a small-scale solution. If we identify climate change as a global phenomenon and present small solutions like purchasing locally produced foods, we risk losing the support of our audience because our solutions will feel ineffective. Motivate individuals by connecting an action like biking to neighborhood air pollution, rather than global warming.
              </p>
              <h3>Underscore collective engagement</h3>
              <p>
                Far reaching problems are less scary when framed in terms of collective solutions. Being a part of a group increases our sense of impact. Our sense of impact in turn influences our motivation to act on a particular issue. When framing our efforts, make the problem an issue faced by “us” rather than “you.”
              </p>
              <h3>Provide feedback</h3>
              <p>
                Receiving information about the results of our behavior can help to enhance our sense of achievement, and fuel our motivation by showing us that our actions can make a difference. When we are able to track our progress, we often feel more motivated to continue toward our goal. Provide frequent constructive feedback for maximum impact.
              </p>
              <h3>Empower the audience</h3>
              <p>
                We can help our audiences feel empowered by showing them what they’re already doing right. By prompting our audiences with questions about preexisting behavior and knowledge, we can show them they have an inherent sense of environmental agency. Alternately, we can inspire the audience by showing them how to extend their knowledge to perform environmental behaviors.
              </p>
              <h3>Focus on behaviors that increase positive environmental impacts</h3>
              <p>
                 Positivity works! The scale of existing environmental damage can often lead us to feel overwhelmed and powerless. Instead of focusing solely on reducing negative impacts, show individuals how they can increase positive impacts on the environment.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Associate" class="tab-pane fade h-color">
              <h2 class="text-color">Frame for the appropriate ASSOCIATIONS</h2>
              <p>
                Key point: We process each piece of new information we receive through our pre-existing values, beliefs, and experiences. Framing messages to better fit our mental models can influence message uptake, agreement, and willingness to act.
              </p>
              <h3>Meet people where they are</h3>
              <p>
                The way we view the world greatly influences how we perceive environmental causes. By tying our messages to our audience’s values, world-views and morals we can increase receptivity and allow our audience a chance to enact their virtues. For example, conservatives may find an initiative framed as a carbon tax unfair, but express interest in the same initiative framed as a carbon offset.
              </p>
              <h3>Highlight the right identity</h3>
              <p>
                As environmental advocates, we can garner support for our efforts by drawing upon the identities and values most related to our causes. When designing messaging, stick with inclusive language and be careful to avoid politically charged language. This might include identifying our audience members as “citizens” rather than “consumers” to ignite their sense of shared duty. Rather than calling a group “environmentalists,” consider calling them “concerned citizens.”
              </p>
              <h3>Use engaging metaphors</h3>
              <p>
                Enhance scientific communication by connecting what our audience is familiar with to abstract environmental processes. Through the use of metaphors, we can effectively guide our audience to situate our issue in the appropriate context. Descriptions like “ocean acidification is osteoporosis of the sea”, help us apply our understanding of how our own bodies operate to more complex scientific phenomena.
              </p>
              <h3>Emphasize potential loss over potential gain</h3>
              <p>
                In general, we hate losing something more than we feel satisfaction from gaining that same thing. To encourage environmental behavior, frame the action in terms of preventing loss or restoring a loss by highlighting an initial level of resources that is threatened or has already been depleted. For example, people are found more willing to offer financial support when forest conservation is framed as regaining previously lost forest health rather than improving current forest health.
              </p>
              <h3>Minimize uncertainty</h3>
              <p>
                Our attention to environmental occurrences diminishes as uncertainty increases. In order to effectively communicate the importance of our environmental issues, we should steer clear of language highlighting any doubt regarding environmental outcomes.
              </p>

            <div id="Vivid" class="tab-pane fade h-color">
              <h2 class="text-color">Design it to be VIVID</h2>
              <p>
                This is a sneak peek at Vivid.  To read the entire chapter, click <a href="">here</a>. <!-- link pending, discuss with Nya -->
              </p>
              <p>
                Key point: Because we are constantly bombarded by information, effective calls to action need to stand out, be original and vividly capture attention!
              </p>
              <h3>Make the target behavior obvious</h3>
              <p>
                Use attention-grabbing design features that make the desired behavior appear striking, obvious, or aesthetically pleasing – such as green footprints that lead to recycling and compost bins. By increasing visual and sensory salience, we can bridge the gap between how our audiences intend to act and how they actually behave.
              </p>
              <h3>Use everyday analogies</h3>
              <p>
                When problems are communicated vividly in terms we are used to, we are more likely to perceive them as immediate and important. We can use engaging photographs and descriptive language to bring the problem to life for our audiences. For example, rather than offering the audience a numeric description of the waste they produce on a yearly basis, consider depicting an image of waste filling the streets on their morning commute.
              </p>
              <h3>Link the action to its impact</h3>
              <p>
                We often remain passive because we aren’t able to see how our everyday actions impact the environment. Consider designing contextual cues that help remind the audience of how their actions directly affect the environmental issue at hand. For example, paper towel dispensers with an outline of South America on them help us to see that each additional piece of paper grabbed contributes to deforestation in the Amazon.
              </p>
              <h3>Focus on immediate impacts</h3>
              <p>
                When discussing the environment, emphasize the most immediate impacts, rather than consequences that will occur in the distant future or the likelihood of the event occurring. This will help to counteract our human tendencies to undervalue faraway events and misinterpret probabilities and make the issue more salient in the minds of our audiences.
              </p>
              <h3>Elevate the desirable choice</h3>
              <p>
                The way choices are presented shapes the way our audiences interact with them and their ultimate preferences. List the most desirable choice at the beginning of written materials, and place less desirable choices elsewhere. List the most important choices first and last in a set of choices to increase recall rates.
              </p>
              <h3>Make the message memorable</h3>
              <p>
                Despite our best intentions, we often lose sight of environmental objectives. Give the audience repeated exposure to the message and related imagery to improve recall and prime them to think further about our issues.
              </p>
              <h3>Callout: Timing matters</h3>
              <p>
                Time the message to correspond with relevant occurrences, as environmental messages may be more salient in our minds at these times. For example, consider highlighting the message following an extreme environmental event or an unplanned disturbance such as a rise in gas prices. Conversely, wait until events that are incongruent with your environmental aim have passed to begin a campaign – the audience might have trouble conserving water to mitigate a drought in the middle of a storm.g
