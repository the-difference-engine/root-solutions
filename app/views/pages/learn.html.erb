      We have taken a unique approach to harnessing behavioral science for environmental initiatives. Rather than relying on the practices and understandings from just one of the available approaches, we have synthesized the available behavioral research into a unified, practical, step-by-step process. We use this framework in our <%= link_to "consulting", "/work_with_us"%> practice,  as well as when <%= link_to "training", "/work_with_us"%> environmental leaders how to harness behavioral science on their own.

    Our searchable database is an excellent way to find articles, videos and case studies relevant to your own work. You can see examples of behavioral science initiatives organized by both environmental topic, such as energy reduction, green transportation and waste reduction, as well as by behavioral design principle, such as framing, using social norms and providing feedback.â€‹
