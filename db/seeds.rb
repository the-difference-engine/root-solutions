L.,  Braman, D., & Mandel, G. N. ", date: "2011-01-01", abstract: "The conventional explanation for controversy over climate change emphasizes impediments to public understanding: Limited popular knowledge of science, the inability of ordinary citizens to assess technical information, and the resulting widespread use of unreliable cognitive heuristics to assess risk. A large survey of U.S. adults (N = 1540) found little support for this account. On the whole, the most scientifically literate and numerate subjects were slightly less likely, not more, to see climate change as a serious threat than the least scientifically literate and numerate ones. More importantly, greater scientific literacy and numeracy were associated with greater cultural polarization: Respondents predisposed by their values to dismiss climate change evidence became more dismissive, and those predisposed by their values to credit such evidence more concerned, as science literacy and numeracy increased. We suggest that this evidence reflects a conflict between two levels of rationality: The individual level, which is characterized by citizens� effective use of their knowledge and reasoning capacities to form risk perceptions that express their cultural commitments; and the collective level, which is characterized by citizens� failure to converge on the best available scientific evidence on how to promote their common welfare. Dispelling this, �tragedy of the risk-perception commons,� we argue, should be understood as the central aim of the science of science communication.", url: "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1871503", admin_notes: "Selecting audience, counter-effects of providing more scientific information to people", world_region_id: 2, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: true, is_problem: true, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "Social Science Research Network Electronic Journal", source: nil, length: nil},

But are we destined to continue with this divergence? We suggest that there is movement around these differences based on the politicization of climate change and we conducted two experimental studies with 126 and 646 people, respectively, to examine this effect. We found that those people whose political identity was made salient were less likely to believe in an anthropogenic cause of climate change and less likely to support government climate change policies than those whose identity was not made salient; particularly when those people were aligned with the right-wing of politics. The results demonstrate the importance of the salience of one's political identity in determining attitudes and beliefs even for scientific facts such as climate change.

It is likely that public consensus is also needed to support policies that might counteract it. It is therefore important to understand how people form and update their beliefs about climate change. Using unique survey data on beliefs about the occurrence of the effects of global warming, I estimate how local temperature fluctuations influence what individuals believe about these effects. I find that some features of the updating process are consistent with rational updating. I also test explicitly for the presence of several heuristics known to affect belief formation and find strong evidence for representativeness, some evidence for availability, and no evidence for spreading activation. I find that very short-run temperature fluctuations (1 day�2 weeks) have no effect on beliefs about the occurrence of global warming, but that longer-run fluctuations (1 month�1 year) are significant predictors of beliefs.

Farmers face pressures to adjust agricultural systems to make them more resilient in the face of increasingly variable weather (adaptation) and reduce GHG production (mitigation). This research examines relationships between Iowa farmers� trust in environmental or agricultural interest groups as sources of climate information, climate change beliefs, perceived climate risks to agriculture, and support for adaptation and mitigation responses. Results indicate that beliefs varied with trust, and beliefs in turn had a significant direct effect on perceived risks from climate change. Support for adaptation varied with perceived risks, while attitudes toward GHG reduction (mitigation) were associated predominantly with variation in beliefs. Most farmers were supportive of adaptation responses, but few endorsed GHG reduction, suggesting that outreach should focus on interventions that have adaptive and mitigative properties (e.g., reduced tillage, improved fertilizer management).", url: "http://eab.sagepub.com/content/47/2/205", admin_notes: nil, world_region_id: 2, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: true, is_problem: false, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "Sage Journals", source: nil, length: nil},
#   {title: "Optimism Bias About Environmental Degradation: The Role of the Range of Impact of Precautions", author: "Hatfield, J., &  Job, R. F. S.", date: "2001-01-01", abstract: "Optimism bias regarding environmental degradation may inhibit pro-environmental behaviour. Two studies established that optimism bias regarding environmental events exists and its determinants were investigated. In study 1 (n=86) optimism bias was observed regarding some aspects of environmental degradation (e.g. air pollution affecting the local area), but not others. These results are consistent with the egocentrism account of optimism bias; egocentric focus on personal precautions may not contribute to optimism bias if others are also perceived to benefit from one's own personal precautions. Study 2 (n=121) assessed this hypothesis employing a manipulation of the perceived range of impact of risk-relevant behaviours. Subjects judged the likelihood that they and their average peer would be affected by environmental hazards, phrased in either general terms (e.g. air pollution) or specific terms (e.g. respiratory problems due to air pollution). Control subjects made estimates about the specific outcomes not explicitly related to the environment (e.g. respiratory problems). Subjects identified behaviours which influence the likelihood of being affected by each hazard. As predicted, subjects asked about general environmental hazards nominated behaviours likely to benefit many people (e.g. reduced use of ozone-damaging chemicals) and demonstrated less optimism bias than subjects asked about specific consequences of the same hazards. Optimism bias was negatively correlated with range of impact of precautions. Thus, optimism bias regarding environmental degradation may be limited by a tendency to focus on pro-environmental behaviours with a wide range of impact.", url: "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494400901907", admin_notes: "optimism bias", world_region_id: 3, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: true, is_problem: true, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "Journal of Environmental Psychology", source: nil, length: nil},

We examine two factors that may contribute to the prevalence of these false or unsupported beliefs. First, many people have not been exposed to clear factual information. If so, presenting correct information in a more compelling format should reduce misperceptions. In some cases, however, people may instead reject accurate information because it threatens their worldview or self-concept - a mechanism that can be revealed by affirming individuals� self-worth, which could make them more willing to acknowledge uncomfortable facts. We find support for both hypotheses. Our results indicate that providing information in graphical form reduces misperceptions. However, self-affirmation can also help decrease misperceptions even if no other information is provided.

This paper describes a study of three of them: the predominance of heuristic-driven information processing by members of the public; ideologically motivated reasoning; and the cognitive-style correlates of political conservativism. The study generated both observational and experimental data inconsistent with the hypothesis that political conservatism is distinctively associated with either unreflective thinking or motivated reasoning. Conservatives did no better or worse than liberals on the Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005), an objective measure of information-processing dispositions associated with cognitive biases. In addition, the study found that ideologically motivated reasoning is not a consequence of over-reliance on heuristic or intuitive forms of reasoning generally. On the contrary, subjects who scored highest in cognitive reflection were the most likely to display ideologically motivated cognition. These findings corroborated an alternative hypothesis, which identifies ideologically motivated cognition as a form of information processing that promotes individuals� interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important affinity groups. The paper discusses the practical significance of these findings, including the need to develop science communication strategies that shield policy-relevant facts from the influences that turn them into divisive symbols of political identity.", url: "http://journal.sjdm.org/13/13313/jdm13313.pdf", admin_notes: nil, world_region_id: 2, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: true, is_problem: true, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "Judgment and Decision Making", source: nil, length: nil},

We found that warmth influenced belief in global warming (Studies 1�3) and that thirst impacted forecasts of drought and desertification (Study 5). These effects emerged in a naturalistic setting (Study 1) and in experimental lab settings (Studies 2, 3, and 5). Studies 2� 6 distinguished between 3 mechanistic accounts: temperature as information (Studies 2 and 3), conceptual accessibility (Studies 4 and 5), and fluency of simulation (Studies 6a and 6b). Studies 2 and 3 ruled out the temperature as information account. Feeling warm enhanced belief in global warming even when temperature was manipulated in an uninformative indoor setting, when participants� attention was first directed to the indoor temperature, and when participants� belief about the current outdoor temperature was statistically controlled. Studies 4 and 5 ruled out conceptual accessibility as the key mediator: Priming the corresponding concepts did not produce analogous effects on judgment. Studies 6a and 6b used a causal chain design and found support for a �simulational fluency� account. Participants experiencing the visceral state of warmth constructed more fluent mental representations of hot (vs. cold) outdoor images, and those who were led to construe the same hot outdoor images more fluently believed more in global warming. Together, the results suggest that visceral states can influence one�s beliefs by making matching states of the world easier to simulate and therefore seem more likely.", url: "http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/409296/7141854/1304571558863/Risen_Critcher_GW.pdf?token=y3KOy%2B2Wp0gewwTxsKKiIZ%2BNAQI%3D", admin_notes: nil, world_region_id: 2, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: true, is_problem: false, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "Journal of Personality and Social Psychology", source: nil, length: nil},

Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in-depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance�temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty�in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance.

Insufficient concern and trust also complicate the transfer of scientific descriptions of climate change and climate variability from scientists to the public, politicians, and policy makers, which is not a simple transmission of facts. Instead, worldview and political ideology, two elements of the cultural context of decisions, guide attention toward events that threaten the desired or existing social order, and shape expectations of change, which in turn guide the detection and interpretation of climate events. Action that follows from climate change perceptions can be informed by different processes. Affect-based decisions about climate change are unlikely to motivate significant action, as politicians and the general public are not particularly worried about climate risks, and because attempts to scare people into greater action may have unintended negative consequences. Analysis-based decisions are also unlikely to result in significant action, because of large discounting of uncertain future costs of climate risks compared to the certain and immediate costs of climate change mitigation.

MPPACC separates out the psychological steps to taking action in response\rto perception, and allows one to see where the most important bottlenecks occur�including risk perception and perceived adaptive\rcapacity, a factor largely neglected in previous climate change research. We then examine two case studies�one from urban\rGermany and one from rural Zimbabwe�to explore the validity of MPPACC to explaining adaptation. In the German study, we\rfind that MPPACC provides better statistical power than traditional socio-economic models. In the Zimbabwean case study, we find\ra qualitative match between MPPACC and adaptive behaviour. Finally, we discuss the important implications of our findings both\ron vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and on efforts to promote adaptation through outside intervention.", url: "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800500004X", admin_notes: nil, world_region_id: 6, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: false, is_problem: false, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "Global Environmental Change", source: nil, length: nil},

Even if people are informed and warned about the arrival of a flood, cyclone, or earthquake, they hesitate to take precautions or leave the area. In some cases, they have to be forced to take refuge in the shelters built for this purpose. They seem to be helpless victims accepting their fate. This is especially the case in Bangladesh, a country which is frequently affected by floods, tornadoes, and cyclones. The affected people, mostly Muslim, regard these hazards as an act of Allah. Through the events He is showing His will and power against which they cannot and should not do anything. In the view of aid agencies, this perception and explanation hampers both external as well as indigenous efforts to survive disasters. However, the findings of my research on local perception and strategies to cope with floods reveal this conception to be a healthy reaction, self-help strategy to overcome crises as quickly as possible and return to daily life. As Allah has given the floods, He will also give believers the strength to survive them. The religious explanation prevents those affected literally wasting time and energy asking why disasters happen to them and not to others.", url: "http://www.ijmed.org/articles/167/", admin_notes: nil, world_region_id: 7, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: false, is_problem: true, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters", source: nil, length: nil},

Yet, given that environmental decisions represent trade-offs between present sacrifices and uncertain future benefits, psychological factors may also play a role in country-level environmental behavior. Gott�s principle suggests that citizens may use perceptions of their country�s age to predict its future continuation, with longer pasts predicting longer futures. Using country- and individual-level analyses, we examined whether longer perceived pasts result in longer perceived futures, which in turn motivate concern for continued environmental quality. Study 1 found that older countries scored higher on an environmental performance index, even when the analysis controlled for country-level differences in gross domestic product and governance. Study 2 showed that when the United States was framed as an old country (vs. a young one), participants were willing to donate more money to an environmental organization.

#   {title: "Are flood victims more concerned about climate change than other people? The role of direct experience in risk perception and behavioural response", author: "Whitmarsh, L.", date: "2008-01-01", abstract: "Climate change is a threat to human health and life, both now and in the future. Despite this, studies show that the public typically do not consider the issue a priority concern or a direct, Relatable threat. Furthermore, few are taking any preventive or protective action. Previous studies identify direct experience as a major influence on risk perception, learning and action. Drawing on such evidence, this paper focuses on the intangibility of climate change as a key impediment to Relatable engagement and explores whether relevant experiences of flooding and air pollution influence individuals' knowledge, attitudes, risk perception and behavioural responses to climate change. Perhaps surprisingly, interviews and a survey conducted in the south of England indicate flood victims differ very little from other participants in their understanding of and responses to climate change, but that experience of air pollution does significantly affect perceptions of and behavioural responses to climate change. Air pollution victims are no more likely to cite pollution as a cause of climate change than non_victims; but they do have higher pro_environmental values. Respondents with these values are significantly more likely to consider climate change a salient risk and to take action in response to it. Therefore the relationship between air pollution experience and responses to climate change may be indirect and mediated by environmental values. The paper concludes by highlighting implications of this research for developing climate change policies and strategies for public engagement.", url: "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13669870701552235", admin_notes: nil, world_region_id: 5, news_source_id: 1, resource_type_id: 8, is_published: true, is_problem: false, cognitive_bium_id: 3, content: nil, academic_citation: nil, publisher: "Journal of Risk Research", source: nil, length: nil},

#   {title: "Solution aversion: On the relation between ideology and motivated disbelief", author: "Campbell, T. H., & Kay, A. C.", date: "2014-01-01", abstract: "There is often a curious distinction between what the scientific community and the general population believe to be true of dire scientific issues, and this skepticism tends to vary markedly across groups. For instance, in the case of climate change, Republicans (conservatives) are especially skeptical of the relevant science, particularly when they are compared with Democrats (liberals). What causes such radical group differences? We suggest, as have previous accounts, that this phenomenon is often motivated. However, the source of this motivation is not necessarily an aversion to the problem, per se, but an aversion to the solutions associated with the problem. This difference in underlying process holds important implications for understanding, predicting, and influencing motivated skepticism. In 4 studies, we tested this�solution aversion�explanation for why people are often so divided over evidence and why this divide often occurs so saliently across political party lines. Studies 1, 2, and 3�using correlational and experimental methodologies�demonstrated that Republicans� increased skepticism toward environmental sciences may be partly attributable to a conflict between specific ideological values and the most popularly discussed environmental solutions. Study 4 found that, in a different domain (crime), those holding a more liberal ideology (support for gun control) also show skepticism motivated by solution aversion.

The literature in behavior economics provides many examples of how people make decisions under conditions of uncertainty relying on inappropriate heuristics, leading to inconsistent and counterproductive choices. Modern risk communication practices recommend a number of methods to overcome these hurdles, which have been recommended for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports. This paper evaluates the success of the most recent IPCC approach to uncertainty communication, based on a controlled survey of climate change experts. Evaluating the results from the survey, and from a similar survey recently conducted among university students, the paper suggests that the most recent IPCC approach leaves open the possibility for biased and inconsistent responses to the information.

One possible explanation for this pattern is that information about the potentially dire consequences of global warming threatens deeply held beliefs that the world is just, orderly, and stable. Individuals overcome this threat by denying or discounting the existence of global warming, and this process ultimately results in decreased willingness to counteract climate change.
