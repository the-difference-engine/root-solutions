Caley's office conducted an experiment in which military truck drivers were given gauges that allowed them to monitor the fuel efficiency of their vehicles--leading to increases in fuel efficiency of 40%.

As female swimmers approached the shower, the researcher invited them to help with a water conservation project. Willing participants were then randomly assigned to one of four conditions.In the hypocrisy condition, the researcher made participants aware that their behaviors did not always match their values by first asking questions such as, �When showering, do you ALWAYS turn off the water while soaping up or shampooing?�She then asked each participant to display her support for water conservation by printing her name in thick black marker on a public flyer that would be posted around campus. The flyer read:�Please conserve water. Take shorter showers. Turn showers off while soaping up. IF I CAN DO IT, SO CAN YOU!�In the waste awareness condition, the experimenter asked participants the questions about wasting water, but did not invite them to sign the flyer.In the public commitment condition, participants signed the flyer, but did not answer the questions.Finally, in the control condition, participants simply saw a sign outside of the shower room that read: �Take Shorter Showers. Turn the Water Off While Soaping Up.�After each of these four experimental manipulations, the participants hit the showers. Unbeknownst to them, however, a second researcher timed how long they spent bathing.The researchers discovered that participants in the hypocrisy condition spent an average of only 3 minutes, 41 seconds showering, compared to 5 minutes in the control condition.

Yet in situ observations suggest that very few students use cold water. Focus groups and online surveys revealed that the main barrier to using cold water among the student body was ignorance of the benefits associated with the use of cold water as well as uncertainty about which button corresponded with the cold water setting.To counteract these barriers, posters that listed the benefits of using cold water were hung in every laundry room. A sticker with the phrase �Cool Is Clean: Use Bright Colors� was placed on every washing machine just above the choice buttons. Systematic observations before and after the intervention revealed a significant increase in the use of cold water in the laundry rooms with stickers and posters (from 0% to 45%).",http://new.oberlin.edu/office/environmental-sustainability/CBSM/Laundry_Pilot_2015+Final+Report.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,
