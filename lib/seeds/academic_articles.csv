",Social Science Research Network Electronic Journal,2011,"The conventional explanation for controversy over climate change emphasizes impediments to public understanding: Limited popular knowledge of science, the inability of ordinary citizens to assess technical information, and the resulting widespread use of unreliable cognitive heuristics to assess risk. A large survey of U.S. adults (N = 1540) found little support for this account. On the whole, the most scientifically literate and numerate subjects were slightly less likely, not more, to see climate change as a serious threat than the least scientifically literate and numerate ones. More importantly, greater scientific literacy and numeracy were associated with greater cultural polarization: Respondents predisposed by their values to dismiss climate change evidence became more dismissive, and those predisposed by their values to credit such evidence more concerned, as science literacy and numeracy increased. We suggest that this evidence reflects a conflict between two levels of rationality: The individual level, which is characterized by citizens� effective use of their knowledge and reasoning capacities to form risk perceptions that express their cultural commitments; and the collective level, which is characterized by citizens� failure to converge on the best available scientific evidence on how to promote their common welfare. Dispelling this, �tragedy of the risk-perception commons,� we argue, should be understood as the central aim of the science of science communication.",http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1871503,"Selecting audience, counter-effects of providing more scientific information to people",,,,,,,,,,,,

But are we destined to continue with this divergence? We suggest that there is movement around these differences based on the politicization of climate change and we conducted two experimental studies with 126 and 646 people, respectively, to examine this effect. We found that those people whose political identity was made salient were less likely to believe in an anthropogenic cause of climate change and less likely to support government climate change policies than those whose identity was not made salient; particularly when those people were aligned with the right-wing of politics. The results demonstrate the importance of the salience of one's political identity in determining attitudes and beliefs even for scientific facts such as climate change.

The effects of local weather fluctuations on beliefs about global warming,"Deryugina, T.",Climatic Change,2013,"Global warming has become a controversial public policy issue in spite of broad scientific consensus that it is real and that human activity is a contributing factor. It is likely that public consensus is also needed to support policies that might counteract it. It is therefore important to understand how people form and update their beliefs about climate change. Using unique survey data on beliefs about the occurrence of the effects of global warming, I estimate how local temperature fluctuations influence what individuals believe about these effects. I find that some features of the updating process are consistent with rational updating. I also test explicitly for the presence of several heuristics known to affect belief formation and find strong evidence for representativeness, some evidence for availability, and no evidence for spreading activation. I find that very short-run temperature fluctuations (1 day�2 weeks) have no effect on beliefs about the occurrence of global warming, but that longer-run fluctuations (1 month�1 year) are significant predictors of beliefs.

This research examines relationships between Iowa farmers� trust in environmental or agricultural interest groups as sources of climate information, climate change beliefs, perceived climate risks to agriculture, and support for adaptation and mitigation responses. Results indicate that beliefs varied with trust, and beliefs in turn had a significant direct effect on perceived risks from climate change. Support for adaptation varied with perceived risks, while attitudes toward GHG reduction (mitigation) were associated predominantly with variation in beliefs.

Two studies established that optimism bias regarding environmental events exists and its determinants were investigated. In study 1 (n=86) optimism bias was observed regarding some aspects of environmental degradation (e.g. air pollution affecting the local area), but not others. These results are consistent with the egocentrism account of optimism bias; egocentric focus on personal precautions may not contribute to optimism bias if others are also perceived to benefit from one's own personal precautions. Study 2 (n=121) assessed this hypothesis employing a manipulation of the perceived range of impact of risk-relevant behaviours. Subjects judged the likelihood that they and their average peer would be affected by environmental hazards, phrased in either general terms (e.g. air pollution) or specific terms (e.g. respiratory problems due to air pollution). Control subjects made estimates about the specific outcomes not explicitly related to the environment (e.g. respiratory problems). Subjects identified behaviours which influence the likelihood of being affected by each hazard. As predicted, subjects asked about general environmental hazards nominated behaviours likely to benefit many people (e.g. reduced use of ozone-damaging chemicals) and demonstrated less optimism bias than subjects asked about specific consequences of the same hazards. Optimism bias was negatively correlated with range of impact of precautions. Thus, optimism bias regarding environmental degradation may be limited by a tendency to focus on pro-environmental behaviours with a wide range of impact.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494400901907,optimism bias,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine two factors that may contribute to the prevalence of these false or unsupported beliefs. First, many people have not been exposed to clear factual information. If so, presenting correct information in a more compelling format should reduce misperceptions. In some cases, however, people may instead reject accurate information because it threatens their worldview or self-concept - a mechanism that can be revealed by affirming individuals� self-worth, which could make them more willing to acknowledge uncomfortable facts. We find support for both hypotheses. Our results indicate that providing information in graphical form reduces misperceptions. However, self-affirmation can also help decrease misperceptions even if no other information is provided. Misperceptions are thus not simply the result of a lack of information - our results suggest many people could offer correct answers if they were less psychologically threatening.",http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/opening-political-mind.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Social scientists have used empirical methods to identify which of the myriad mechanisms that could plausibly be responsible for public conflict over climate change actually are.

This paper describes a study of three of them: the predominance of heuristic-driven information processing by members of the public; ideologically motivated reasoning; and the cognitive-style correlates of political conservativism. The study generated both observational and experimental data inconsistent with the hypothesis that political conservatism is distinctively associated with either unreflective thinking or motivated reasoning. Conservatives did no better or worse than liberals on the Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005), an objective measure of information-processing dispositions associated with cognitive biases. In addition, the study found that ideologically motivated reasoning is not a consequence of over-reliance on heuristic or intuitive forms of reasoning generally. On the contrary, subjects who scored highest in cognitive reflection were the most likely to display ideologically motivated cognition. These findings corroborated an alternative hypothesis, which identifies ideologically motivated cognition as a form of information processing that promotes individuals� interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important affinity groups. The paper discusses the practical significance of these findings, including the need to develop science communication strategies that shield policy-relevant facts from the influences that turn them into divisive symbols of political identity.",http://journal.sjdm.org/13/13313/jdm13313.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we expect compassion for other humans to relate positively to proenvironmental tendencies. Two studies were conducted to test this assumption. Study 1 included three independent samples (final N = 2,096) and several measures of proenvironmental tendencies. Results revealed that compassion was indeed positively related to proenvironmental values, proenvironmental intentions and reported donations to nature or environmental organizations.

We found that warmth influenced belief in global warming (Studies 1�3) and that thirst impacted forecasts of drought and desertification (Study 5). These effects emerged in a naturalistic setting (Study 1) and in experimental lab settings (Studies 2, 3, and 5). Studies 2� 6 distinguished between 3 mechanistic accounts: temperature as information (Studies 2 and 3), conceptual accessibility (Studies 4 and 5), and fluency of simulation (Studies 6a and 6b). Studies 2 and 3 ruled out the temperature as information account. Feeling warm enhanced belief in global warming even when temperature was manipulated in an uninformative indoor setting, when participants� attention was first directed to the indoor temperature, and when participants� belief about the current outdoor temperature was statistically controlled. Studies 4 and 5 ruled out conceptual accessibility as the key mediator: Priming the corresponding concepts did not produce analogous effects on judgment. Studies 6a and 6b used a causal chain design and found support for a �simulational fluency� account. Participants experiencing the visceral state of warmth constructed more fluent mental representations of hot (vs. cold) outdoor images, and those who were led to construe the same hot outdoor images more fluently believed more in global warming. Together, the results suggest that visceral states can influence one�s beliefs by making matching states of the world easier to simulate and therefore seem more likely.",http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/409296/7141854/1304571558863/Risen_Critcher_GW.pdf?token=y3KOy%2B2Wp0gewwTxsKKiIZ%2BNAQI%3D,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in-depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance�temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty�in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance.

Insufficient concern and trust also complicate the transfer of scientific descriptions of climate change and climate variability from scientists to the public, politicians, and policy makers, which is not a simple transmission of facts. Instead, worldview and political ideology, two elements of the cultural context of decisions, guide attention toward events that threaten the desired or existing social order, and shape expectations of change, which in turn guide the detection and interpretation of climate events. Action that follows from climate change perceptions can be informed by different processes. Affect-based decisions about climate change are unlikely to motivate significant action, as politicians and the general public are not particularly worried about climate risks, and because attempts to scare people into greater action may have unintended negative consequences. Analysis-based decisions are also unlikely to result in significant action, because of large discounting of uncertain future costs of climate risks compared to the certain and immediate costs of climate change mitigation.

Through the events He is showing His will and power against which they cannot and should not do anything. In the view of aid agencies, this perception and explanation hampers both external as well as indigenous efforts to survive disasters. However, the findings of my research on local perception and strategies to cope with floods reveal this conception to be a healthy reaction, self-help strategy to overcome crises as quickly as possible and return to daily life.

Despite this, studies show that the public typically do not consider the issue a priority concern or a direct, Relatable threat. Furthermore, few are taking any preventive or protective action. Previous studies identify direct experience as a major influence on risk perception, learning and action. Drawing on such evidence, this paper focuses on the intangibility of climate change as a key impediment to Relatable engagement and explores whether relevant experiences of flooding and air pollution influence individuals' knowledge, attitudes, risk perception and behavioural responses to climate change. Perhaps surprisingly, interviews and a survey conducted in the south of England indicate flood victims differ very little from other participants in their understanding of and responses to climate change, but that experience of air pollution does significantly affect perceptions of and behavioural responses to climate change. Air pollution victims are no more likely to cite pollution as a cause of climate change than non_victims; but they do have higher pro_environmental values. Respondents with these values are significantly more likely to consider climate change a salient risk and to take action in response to it. Therefore the relationship between air pollution experience and responses to climate change may be indirect and mediated by environmental values.

Gott�s principle suggests that citizens may use perceptions of their country�s age to predict its future continuation, with longer pasts predicting longer futures. Using country- and individual-level analyses, we examined whether longer perceived pasts result in longer perceived futures, which in turn motivate concern for continued environmental quality. Study 1 found that older countries scored higher on an environmental performance index, even when the analysis controlled for country-level differences in gross domestic product and governance.

Using large-scale survey data, we show that people are less likely to engage in environmental behavior if they are paid by the hour, a form of compensation that leads people to see their time as money. Using experimental methodology, we show that making the economic value of time salient reduces environmental intentions and behavior. This occurs in part because thinking about the economic value of time creates awareness of the opportunity costs associated with environmental behavior. We mitigate these effects by reframing environmental behavior as an act consistent with self-interest.

U. ",climatic change,2006,"It should come as no surprise that the governments and citizenries of many countries show little concern about climate change and its consequences. Behavioral decision research over the last 30 years provides a series of lessons about the importance of affect in perceptions of risk and in decisions to take actions that reduce or manage perceived risks. Evidence from a range of domains suggests that worry drives risk management decisions. When people fail to be alarmed about a risk or hazard, they do not take precautions. Recent Relatable experience strongly influences the evaluation of a risky option. Low-probability events generate less concern than their probability warrants on average, but more concern than they deserve in those rare instances when they do occur. Relatable experience with noticeable and serious consequences of global warming is still rare in many regions of the world. When people base their decisions on statistical descriptions about a hazard provided by others, characteristics of the hazard identified as psychological risk dimensions predict differences in alarm or worry across different classes of risk. The time-delayed, abstract, and often statistical nature of the risks of global warming does not evoke strong visceral reactions. These results suggest that we should find ways to evoke visceral reactions towards the risk of global warming, perhaps by simulations of its concrete future consequences for people's home or other regions they visit or value. Increased concern about global warming needs to solicited carefully, however, to prevent a decrease in concern about other relevant risks. The generation of worry or concern about global warming may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for desirable or Resonate protective or mitigating behavior on part of the general public.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-006-9060-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E.",PLOS One,2012,"In response to agriculture's vulnerability and contribution to climate change, many governments are developing initiatives that promote the adoption of mitigation and adaptation practices among farmers. Since most climate policies affecting agriculture rely on voluntary efforts by individual farmers, success requires a sound understanding of the factors that motivate farmers to change practices. Recent evidence suggests that past experience with the effects of climate change and the psychological distance associated with people's concern for global and local impacts can influence environmental behavior. Here we surveyed farmers in a representative rural county in California's Central Valley to examine how their intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation practices is influenced by previous climate experiences and their global and local concerns about climate change. Perceived changes in water availability had significant effects on farmers' intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies, which were mediated through global and local concerns respectively. This suggests that mitigation is largely motivated by psychologically distant concerns and beliefs about climate change, while adaptation is driven by psychologically proximate concerns for local impacts. This match between attitudes and behaviors according to the psychological distance at which they are cognitively construed indicates that policy and outreach initiatives may benefit by framing climate impacts and behavioral goals concordantly; either in a global context for mitigation or a local context for adaptation.",http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052882,Motivation of California Farmers to adopt climate change mitigation measures,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results indicated that, ceteris paribus, gain frames were superior to loss frames in increasing positive attitudes towards climate change mitigation, and also increased the perceived severity of climate change impacts. However, third variable analyses demonstrated that the superiority of the gain frame was partially suppressed by lower fear responses and poorer information recall within gain framed information. In addition, framing climate change impacts as distant (whilst keeping information presented the same) resulted in climate change impacts being perceived as more severe, whilst attitudes towards climate change mitigation were more positive when participants were asked to consider social rather than Relatable aspects of climate change.

However, the strong scientific consensus on the detection, attribution, and risks of climate change stands in stark contrast to widespread confusion, complacency and denial among policymakers and the public. Risk communication is now a major bottleneck preventing science from playing an appropriate role in climate policy. Here I argue that the ability of the IPCC to fulfill its mission can be enhanced through better understanding of the mental models of the audiences it seeks to reach, then altering the presentation and communication of results accordingly. Few policymakers are trained in science, and public understanding of basic facts about climate change is poor. But the problem is deeper. Our mental models lead to persistent errors and biases in complex dynamic systems like the climate and economy. Where the consequences of our actions spill out across space and time, our mental models have narrow boundaries and focus on the short term. Where the dynamics of complex systems are conditioned by multiple feedbacks, time delays, accumulations and nonlinearities, we have difficulty recognizing and understanding feedback processes, underestimate time delays, and do not understand basic principles of accumulation or how nonlinearities can create regime shifts. These problems arise not only among laypeople but also among highly educated elites with significant training in science. They arise not only in complex systems like the climate but also in familiar contexts such as filling a bathtub. Therefore they cannot be remedied merely by providing more information about the climate, but require different modes of communication, including experiential learning environments such as interactive simulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in the case of climate change, public polarization about the issue has increased in recent years, not diminished. In this study, we draw from theories of motivated reasoning, social identity, and persuasion to examine how science-based messages may increase public polarization on controversial science issues such as climate change. Exposing 240 adults to simulated news stories about possible climate change health impacts on different groups, we found the influence of identification with potential victims was contingent on participants� political partisanship. This partisanship increased the degree of political polarization on support for climate mitigation policies and resulted in a boomerang effect among Republican participants. Implications for understanding the role of motivated reasoning within the context of science communication are discussed. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It draws upon three mixed-method studies, with an emphasis on the qualitative data which offer an in-depth insight into how people make sense of climate change. The paper defines engagement as an individual�s state, comprising three elements: cognitive, affective and behavioural. A number of common barriers emerge from the three studies, which operate broadly at �individual� and �social� levels. These major constraints to individual engagement with climate change have implications for achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gases in the UK.

L.",Ecology and Society,2009,"In 1973, Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist cross-trained in philosophy, sociology, and psychiatry, invoked consciousness of self and the inevitability of death as the primary sources of human anxiety and repression. He proposed that the psychological basis of cooperation, competition, and emotional and mental health is a tendency to hold tightly to anxiety-buffering cultural world views or �immortality projects� that serve as the basis for self-esteem and meaning. Although he focused mainly on social and political outcomes like war, torture, and genocide, he was increasingly aware that materialism, denial of nature, and immortality-striving efforts to control, rather than sanctify, the natural world were problems whose severity was increasing. In this paper I review Becker�s ideas and suggest ways in which they illuminate human response to global climate change. Because immortality projects range from belief in technology and materialism to reverence for nature or belief in a celestial god, they act both as barriers to and facilitators of sustainable practices. I propose that Becker�s cross-disciplinary �science of man,� and the predictions it generates for proximate-level determinants of social behavior, add significantly to our understanding of and potential for managing the people paradox, i.e., that the very things that bring us symbolic immortality often conflict with our prospects for survival. Analysis of immortality projects as one of the proximate barriers to addressing climate change is both cautionary and hopeful, providing insights that should be included in the cross-disciplinary quest to uncover new pathways toward rational, social change.

We present results from three Q-methodology workshops held in Melbourne (Australia), Norwich (UK) and Boulder (USA) investigating engagement with climate change imagery drawn from mass media sources. Participants were provided with a concourse of climate change images drawn from a newspaper content analysis carried out across all three countries, and asked to carry out two Q-sorts: first, for salience (�this image makes me feel climate change is important�) and second, for efficacy (�this image makes me feel I can do something about climate change�). We found results remarkably consistent both across and within country cohorts. This may indicate the presence of a dominant, mainstream discourse around climate imagery. We found that imagery of climate impacts promotes feelings of salience, but undermines self-efficacy; that imagery of energy futures imagery promotes self-efficacy; and that images of politicians and celebrities strongly undermine saliency, and undermine self-efficacy for the Australian cohort. These results, if widely replicable, have implications for climate change communication and engagement. Our results suggest that imagery plays a role in either increasing the sense of importance of the issue of climate change (saliency), or in promoting feelings of being able to do something about climate change (efficacy) � but few, if any, images seem to do both. Communications strategies should assess the purpose of their messages, considering these findings regarding salience and efficacy in this study, and choose to employ images accordingly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a thematic analysis of newspaper images, three broad themes emerged: the impact of climate change, personification of climate change and representation of climate change in graphical form. In particular, the depiction of climate change as an issue affecting domestic populations rather than just other areas of the world brings the threat closer to home. Challenging the perception that climate change is still a long-term and future-orientated threat, visual images concretise the risk by providing viewers with tangible examples of climate change�s impact.

A better understanding of the underlying psychology of this effect can help explain the public�s reaction to climate change and inform approaches used to communicate the phenomenon. Across five studies, we find evidence of attribute substitution, whereby individuals use less relevant but available information (for example, today�s temperature) in place of more diagnostic but less accessible information (for example, global climate change patterns) when making judgements. Moreover, we rule out alternative hypotheses involving climate change labelling and lay mental models. Ultimately, we show that present temperature abnormalities are given undue weight and lead to an overestimation of the frequency of similar past events, thereby increasing belief in and concern for global warming.

We examine five factors that should account for changes in levels of concern: 1) extreme weather events, 2) public access to accurate scientific information, 3) media coverage, 4) elite cues, and 5) movement/countermovement advocacy. A time-series analysis indicates that elite cues and structural economic factors have the largest effect on the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, this coverage is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors. Weather extremes have no effect on aggregate public opinion. Promulgation of scientific information to the public on climate change has a minimal effect. The implication would seem to be that information-based science advocacy has had only a minor effect on public concern, while political mobilization by elites and advocacy groups is critical in influencing climate change concern.

R.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2006,"Two of the most important sources of catastrophic risk are terrorism and climate change. The United States has responded aggressively to the risk of terrorism while doing very little about the risk of climate change. For the United States alone, the cost of the Iraq war is now in excess of the anticipated cost of the Kyoto Protocol. The divergence presents a puzzle; it also raises more general questions about both risk perception and the public demand for legislation. The best explanation for the divergence emphasizes bounded rationality. Americans believe that aggressive steps to reduce the risk of terrorism promise to deliver significant benefits in the near future at acceptable cost. By contrast, they believe that aggressive steps to reduce the risk of climate change will not greatly benefit American citizens in the near future�and they are not willing to pay a great deal to reduce that risk. This intuitive form of cost-benefit analysis is much influenced by behavioral factors, including the availability heuristic, probability neglect, outrage, and myopia. All of these contribute, after 9/11, to a willingness to support significant steps to respond to terrorism and to relative indifference to climate change. It follows that Americans are likely to support such steps in response to climate change only if one of two conditions is met: the costs of those steps can be shown to be acceptably low or new information, perhaps including a salient incident, indicates that Americans have much to gain from risk reduction in the relatively near future.

Hence, the knowledge must reach people and the content must be evaluated as important and relevant. In Study 1, knowledge and confidence in one�s own knowledge was studied in a survey among four groups in society: experts, politicians, environmental journalists and laypersons. The study revealed gradually decreasing knowledge levels from experts to journalists, politicians and laypersons. The confidence levels showed a similar pattern. Both knowledge and confidence levels were higher for causes than state and consequences of climate change. All groups had less knowledge of health consequences as compared to weather and sea/glacier consequences. The realism of confidence in their own knowledge was somewhat higher among journalists than among experts, and relatively low among politicians and laypersons. Study II tested to what extent scientific knowledge of various domains was related to cognitive and affective risk judgements among laypersons. Subgroups divided by gender, being a parent or not, education, age and type of residence were analyzed. The results revealed that knowledge of both health consequences and causes of climate change was positively related to cognitive and affective risk judgements. Gender influenced affective but not cognitive risk judgements, as women were more worried than men. Study III revealed that information of scientific uncertainty of climate consequences influence risk perception. Study IV revealed that temporal distance to negative environmental consequences did not influence participants� intention to mitigate CO2 emissions. Taken together, this research represents some steps towards a greater understanding of what facilitates and hinders the process toward a sustainable society. The studies show that scientific knowledge about climate change seems to be disseminated in an unbiased manner in society. Moreover, the results support the claim that both knowledge and confidence levels will increase when people learn more about climate change. In particular, risk awareness can be raised by increased knowledge of health consequences and of causes of climate change. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More�challenging is that they must stay changed. For many reasons the techniques commonly used to promote conservation behavior are more reliable at modulating short-term behavior than at achieving durable change. The perceived urgency of environmental problems tends to make immediate behavior change the major focus. But of equal importance is the stability of behavior once changed. Thus one goal of conservation behavior research is to discover techniques that change individual behavior while minimizing or eliminating the need for repeated intervention. This article categerorizes behavior change techniques first by their informational or motivational nature and second by the source of the change: derived from others or gained by direct personal involvement. Evaluating selected techniques using five proposed dimensions suggests why durable behavior change has been so hard to achieve.

This paper uses the theories of cognitive and behavioral decisionsciences to forward an integrative framework seeking to explain why business executives mayinResonately discount such environmental risks as well as their responsibilities in addressingthese challenges. Following an articulation of the key variables in this framework, the authorthen suggests practical classroom strategies that have been used in executive, graduate andundergraduate business education to counteract judgment biases and errors that predisposeindividuals to deny their responsibilities in addressing the imperatives of environmentalsustainability. Educators as well as internal and external change agents and consultants will findthis paper useful in promoting environmental awareness and responsible decision making.�",http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdhttp://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n4/full/nclimate1378.htmlfviewer?sid=550d6c2f-372a-4241-bffc-40f9c21b1d8d%40sessionmgr4004&crlhashurl=login.aspx%253fdirect%253dtrue%2526profile%253dehost%2526scope%253dsite%2526authtype%253dcrawler%2526jrnl%253d10956328%2526AN%253d64876385&hid=4111&vid=0, ,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tested these hypotheses via an online, stated preference survey of 465 UK residents using actual market pricing and efficiency data for washing machines. The provision of information about either running costs or running emissions did encourage selection of more expensive and efficient products (strongly correlated variables in the choice set and actual market) (po.001, r1�4.30�.41) with no statistically significant difference between their impact. Providing lifetime running cost information also nudged respondents towards more expensive, efficient products than annual information (p 1�4 .006�.027, r1�4.15�.18). Finally, loss-framed running emissions information encouraged selection of more expen- sive, efficient products than gain-framed information (p o .05, r 1�4 .13�.16).

In the long-run, consumers form a new stock of physical capital or consumption habits: if reports are discontinued after two years, the effects are much more persistent than they had been between the initial reports. Remarkably, however, consumers do not fully habituate: they still respond substantially if treatment is continued after two years.

Unfortunately, the administrators and users in these settings often lack proper energy savings strategies, resulting in excessive energy waste. Research in behavioral economics has reliably shown that effort is an inhibitory factor in changing a variety of behaviors. That is, humans have a tendency to choose the option that requires the least amount of effort, regardless of whether that option is the best one. Thus, it might be inferred that interventions requiring greater effort for computer users to conserve energy are unlikely to be effective. This study highlights a successful cost-cutting application of default energy savings settings in a campus computer-testing laboratory. Default settings applied by the research team did not require effort on the part of users and resulted in computers powering-down after a relatively short period of inactivity. A cost analysis revealed modest fiscal and electricity savings among the small number of computers included in the study. However, extrapolating these modest savings across the many hundreds of workstations typically found on university campuses suggests a substantial savings would result from the adoption of the intervention described herein.

Two relatively simple and easy-to-implement interventions were evaluated in a workplace setting during the fall of 2008. The first involved group-level feedback presented monthly to employees via e-mail. The second used peer educators to disseminate information and to encourage colleagues to reduce energy use.

Results indicated that feedback and peer education resulted in a 7% and 4% reduction in energy use, respectively.

The results of this study serve as a guide for campus administration when implementing future environmental programs. At most universities there is a large population living on campus, this creates the opportunity to encourage pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors of a large population. College, for many students, is the first time away from their family home and a time they can develop new attitudes and behaviors. This allows campus administrators the opportunity to influence students at a time in which they are developing new habits. It is important for campus administration to understand the factors that influence students� participation in environmental programs and how to influence students� long term attitudes and behaviors toward environmental concerns.This study determined which factors most strongly influence students to participate in the recycling program within their residence halls. The roles and attitudes of University Housing Staff toward current environmental programs were also assessed. Improved understanding of student participation and administrator roles can help support future environmental efforts on campus.Interviews with administrators showed that while administration may have a reasonable understanding of the factors that influence students to participate in recycling programs; this understanding does not extend to the actual programs that are being implemented. Of the students surveyed in this research, 100% responded that they thought there are improvements that should be made to increase recycling on campus. The factors that should most influence administrators in environmental decisions on campus were explored with student opinions of the current programs.The recycling research completed shows that both convenience and pro- environmental education are important influences on students� decisions to participate in recycling programs within their residence halls. The research shows that recycling increased by 50% with the addition of both convenience and pro-environmental education. Based on the increase in the amount of recycling per person in this study, the addition of these two components throughout the residence halls at Southern Illinois University could result in approximately 3,750 pounds of waste reduction per semester. While convenience has been shown to have an influence on recycling, e.g. Jennings (2004), this study focuses on the influence of pro-environmental education as well.

Residential households have the potential to conserve water, especially across discretionary end uses such as showering. The advent of high resolution smart meters and data loggers allows for the disaggregation of water flow recordings into a registry of water end use events (e.g. showers, washing machine, taps, etc.). This study firstly reports on a water consumption end use study sample of 151 households conducted in the Gold Coast, Australia, with a focus on daily per capita shower end use distributions. A sub-sample of 44 households within the greater sample was recruited for the installation of an alarming visual display monitor locked at 40 litres consumption for bathroom showers. All sub-sample shower end use event durations, volumes and flow rates were then analysed and compared utilising independent sample t-tests pre- and post intervention. The installation of the shower monitor instigated a statistically significant mean reduction of 15.40 litres (27%) in shower event volumes. Monetary savings resulting from modelled water and energy conservation resulted in a 1.65 year payback period for the device. Furthermore, conservative modelling indicated that the citywide implementation of the device could yield 3% and 2.4% savings in total water and energy consumption, respectively. Moreover, a range of non-monetary benefits were indentified, including the deferment of water and energy supply infrastructure, reduced resource inflationary pressures, and climate change mitigation, to name a few. Resource consumption awareness devices like the one evaluated in this study assist resource consumers to take ownership of their usage and individually tackle individualistic and/or society driven conservation goals, ultimately helping to reduce the ecological footprint of built environments.

We bring together three separate insights � implementation intentions (Gollwitzer: 1999, American Psychologist 54(7), 493�503), actual behavioural control (ABC) (Ajzen and Madden: 1986, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 22, 453�474; Sheeran et al.: 2003, Journal of Social Psychology, 42, 393�410) and situational context (SC) (Belk: 1975, Journal of Consumer Research 2, 157�164) � to construct an integrated, holistic conceptual model of the intention�behaviour gap of ethically minded consumers. This holistic conceptual model addresses significant limitations within the ethical consumerism literature, and moves the understanding of ethical consumer behaviour forward. Further, the operationalisation of this model offers insight and strategic direction for marketing managers attempting to bridge the intention�be""",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin_Neville/publication/226351970_Why_Ethical_Consumers_Don't_Walk_Their_Talk_Towards_a_Framework_for_Understanding_the_Gap_Between_the_Ethical_Purchase_Intentions_and_Actual_Buying_Behaviour_of_Ethically_Minded_Consumers/links/00b7d51fe084b9d8fe000000.pdf,Some info on self efficacy in disc ,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research suggests that people automatically evaluate objects as a function of their instrumentality to satisfying active goals. We hypothesized that priming an environmental-protection goal through exposure to a pro-environmental message would produce more positive automatic evaluations and lead people to make the pro-environmental choice of selecting loose rather than packaged products in a hypothetical choice task. As predicted, those primed with an environmental-protection goal automatically evaluated loose products more positively and selected more loose consumer products than a control group. Increased implicit positivity towards loose products mediated the observed behaviour change. Crucially, the effect of environmental goal priming on choices or implicit attitudes towards packaging was not contingent on existing environmental attitudes. Our findings suggest that pro-environmental messages could induce more environmentally friendly consumer choice by leading people to evaluate readily available goal-relevant stimuli positively.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494414000164,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households� behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time.

Respondents (N = 454) were randomly allocated to four different conditions (an information-only, social norm-only, a combination of both, or a control group). It was hypothesized that the combination (i.e., norm-induced information provision) would be most persuasive and elicit the greatest reduction in intentions to buy bottled water. Results were consistent with this hypothesis.

For this purpose, we use the web portal as a test of the theoretical propositions underlying its design.

A review for DEFRA of the literature on metering, billing and direct displays","Darby, S.",Environmental Change Institute,2006,"Most domestic energy use, most of the time, is invisible to the user. Most people have only a vague idea of how much energy they are using for different purposes and what sort of difference they could make by changing day-to-day behaviour or investing in efficiency measures. Hence the importance of feedback in making energy more visible and more amenable to understanding and control. This review considers what is known about the effectiveness of feedback to householders. The focus is on how people change their behaviour, not on the detail of the technology used. There is considerable variety in the feedback literature, but common themes emerge. The first studies, in the 1970s, established that feedback (mostly via display monitors) has measurable effects and was worth pursuing, on its own or in combination with other processes. Feedback came to be seen in terms of a learning tool, allowing energy users to teach themselves through experimentation. Overall, the literature demonstrates that clear feedback is a necessary element in learning how to control fuel use more effectively over a long period of time and that instantaneous direct feedback in combination with frequent, accurate billing (a form of indirect feedback) is needed as a basis for sustained demand reduction. Thus feedback is useful on its own, as a selfteaching tool.

We ran the experiment with more than 40,000 interested customers and tested how they react on different non-binding green energy defaults in the contract offer. The results show that (i) the fraction of consumers willing to purchase an electricity contract does not depend on the default, and (ii) the fraction of customers opting for a contract, delivering only electricity from renewable sources, strongly depends on the default. The fraction of �green� customers is less than 10% when the green energy check box is not set by default and rises to 70% when it is set by default- despite the higher price of the �green� contract. Importantly, in our experimental setting the costs of opting out of the default are negligible when purchasing the contract, but very high in later periods. Due to this cost structure, our results suggest that customers� reactions on defaults cannot be explained by switching costs or procrastination as done in previous literature on default effects.

The first display set isolates and examines specific elements of an eco-feedback design space such as data and time granularity. Displays in the second set act as design probes to elicit reactions about competition, privacy, and integration into domestic space.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of two different representations of water consumption eco-feedback on water conservation (i.e., gallons and associated estimated embodied energy). We collected consumption data in 18 residential dormitories, involving nearly 4700 occupants over a period of approximately six weeks. We found that representing water consumption simultaneously in terms of gallons and associated embodied energy led to a statistically significant reduction in water consumption, while representing water consumption only in terms of gallons did not.

Using the notion of �sustainable lifestyles�, current social marketing policies seek to encourage behaviour change amongst citizens by identifying population segments with similar commitments to environmental practices as the basis for behaviour change initiatives. However, the use of static �lifestyle groups� implies that that citizens replicate sustainable practices across different consumption contexts and this paper explores this line of argument through the use of data collected as part of a recent UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) funded research project on sustainable lifestyles and climate change. Through a series of focus group discussions, participants explored notions of sustainable practices using the home and leisure contexts as framing devices to explore issues of environmental responsibility and climate change. The emphasis placed on practices and context reveal that the comfortable notions of environmental responsibility and sustainable consumption in the home are often in conflict with the discourses of consumption�reduction�associated with climate change in leisure and tourism contexts. In many cases, these �paradoxes� are explicitly referred to, reflected-upon and discussed by participants who demonstrate that notions of sustainable practice are mediated by practice and spaces of consumption. Accordingly, the paper argues that in conceptualising market-based approaches to behaviour change around the notion of �sustainable lifestyles�, researchers and policy makers need to address the role of context and recognise the importance of consumption spaces and the conflicts that may arise between these.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622810001724,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once this credibility check was passed, simulation sessions usually evolvedinto participants interactively inquiring of the model the consequence of alternative managementoptions. These �What if� questions using APSIM were contextualised using local climateand soil data and the farmer�s actual or proposed management rules.The active participation of farmers and their advisers, and working in the context of their ownfarming operations, were the key ingredients in the design, implementation and interpretation ofthe FARMSCAPE approach to decision support. The attraction of the APSIM systems simulatorto farmers contemplating change was that it allowed them to explore their own system in amanner equivalent to learning from experience. To achieve this, APSIM had to be credibleand flexible. While direct engagement of farmers initially enabled only a limited number ofbeneficiaries, this approach generated a commercial market for timely and high quality interactionsbased on soil monitoring and simulation amongst a significant sector of the farmingcommunity. Current efforts are therefore focused on the training, support and accreditationof commercial agronomists in the application of the FARMSCAPE approach and tools.The FARMSCAPE approach to decision support has come to represent an approach to guidingscience-based engagement with farm decision making which is being tested nationally and internationally.Crown Copyright # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

As globalization and urbanization increased during the 1980s, the agents of deforestation changed in two important parts of the tropical biome, the lowland rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. Well-capitalized ranchers, farmers, and loggers producing for consumers in distant markets became more prominent in these places and this globalization weakened the historically strong relationship between local population growth and forest cover.

",Journal of Transport Geography,7/4/05,"It can be argued that the main thinking in transport planning and policy making stem from neoclassical economics in which individuals are largely assumed to make rational, consistent, and efficient choices, and apply cognitive processes of decision making that maximise their economic utility. Research in behavioural sciences indicates that individuals� choices in a wide range of contexts deviate from the pre- dictions of the rational man paradigm inspired the research agenda in the field of travel behaviour. New concepts and practices of government aim to apply some behavioural economics insights in the design of behavioural change initiatives and measures, an approach recently advocated in the US and the UK. This paper provides a brief review on the use and potential of behavioural economics from the perspective of transport and climate change, in two main contexts: travel demand modelling and design of behaviour change measures. The discussion of limitations and knowledge gaps associated with the implementation of behavioural economics to a travel behaviour context might contribute to the debate and help in defin- ing research agenda in this area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiences in several major cities are examined, and estimates are made as to how many of those who are offered employer-paid parking decide to drive alone to work rather than commute by other modes. It appears that approximately 20 percent of those who now drive alone and receive free parking would form carpools or begin using public transit if they were required to pay for parking at the workplace. This estimate is derived from comparisons of the behavior of commuters of similar characteristics who park free and who pay to park and from the results of the imposition of parking charges for parking formerly provided free. The major incentive for employers to provide free parking appears to be the fact that, as a fringe benefit, free parking escapes income taxation. Enforcing the reporting and taxation of its cash value, however, is a difficult and predictably unpopular task. Two policies intended to extend employer parking subsidies to work travel by modes other than the single-occupant automobile are recommended: tax-exempt travel allowances and carpool parking subsidies. Both policies could lead to significant increases in carpooling and transit use at very low or no public expense. ",http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=168329,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as transport-related CO2 emissions are largely seen as a �social� cost rather than a �private� cost to the individual, the behavioural engagement with and response to information on environmental effects of travel choices may therefore be limited. It is argued that framing, studied in a range of contexts, can be used to enhance the evaluation of choice attributes and promote desirable (more sustainable) choices. An experiment is reported that examine the effect of valence framing of amounts of CO2 emissions on the perceived differences between alternative travel modes. Through the use of positive and negative terms, the information was framed to focus attention either on the potential of a travel mode to provide environmental benefit (positive frame) or on its potential to reduce an environmental loss (negative frame). Survey participants� estimates of CO2 amounts were compared for positive and negative framing of the same information using an ordered logit (OL) model. The findings imply that negative framing is more effective than positive framing in highlighting differences between CO2 amounts of alternative travel modes and therefore is more likely to influence travel-related choices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately two months after the group discussion, we obtained questionnaires from the organizer of the meeting and a member of the group who had missed the meeting because of another obligation (i.e., not because of disinterest in the topic). Most organizers were female and analyses were limited to females. This quasi-experimental matched control group design indicated that those who attended the meeting were more favorable towards using nontoxics and more interested in sharing leftover toxic products with friends (instead of discarding them). Path and mediation analyses showed that the organizer�s evaluation of the meeting predicted her final attitude, and perceptions that the group endorsed the material (perceived group norm) partially mediated this relationship. A second mediation analysis showed that evaluation of the meeting predicted intention to share leftover toxics and this relationship was fully mediated by the organizer�s impression that the group would also share leftovers. The results support the idea that persuasion is based both on individual evaluation and normative influence, especially when people are not confident others will accept the behavior, such as sharing leftover toxic products.

",International Conference  on Artificial Intelligence,2007,"Diverse psychological findings were integrated in an agent based simulation model, on how situational cues affect behavior performance including the research areas of conviction-based behavior selection, norm- influences, prospective memory, habits, implementation intention and self-commitment. The model postulates, that a behavior selected for execution is the most preferred one between all remembered behavior alternatives. Whether a behavior is remembered or not depends mainly on its accessibility and habit strength. The stronger a person is committed to perform a behavior, the more certain situational cues remind and urge the person to perform it. To investigate the model time-series data was gathered on a daily base during a campaign in Santiago de Cuba promoting recycling behavior. The data confirmed the reminding and cognitive tension effect of prompts due to a commitment. Habits showed a reminding effect, but no effect on the preference.

As a first attempt to quantify the effects of social norms, we studied the effects of a series of possible factors on people's intentions of maintaining forest on their Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) land plots if the program ends. GTGP is one of the world's largest PES programs and plays an important role in global conservation efforts. Our study was conducted in China's Wolong Nature Reserve, home to the world-famous endangered giant pandas and >4,500 farmers. We found that, in addition to conservation payment amounts and program duration, social norms at the neighborhood level had significant impacts on program re-enrollment, suggesting that social norms can be used to leverage participation to enhance the sustainability of conservation benefits from PES programs. Moreover, our results demonstrate that economic and demographic trends also have profound implications for sustainable conservation.

Respondents had a mean score of 6.2 on a 10-question knowledge scale, and supported manatee conservation efforts with a mean score of 3.84 on a 5-point support scale based on seven statements. Boaters indicated more support for increased public education than for stringent regulations such as speed and wake limits in sea grass areas, no-entry areas, or increased patrols. Greater knowledge about manatees was positively correlated with support for manatee conservation. To understand boating behaviors, we used the sociopsychological theory of reasoned action to analyze boaters' disregard for speed zones.

Hobbs, and S. A. Moore",Ecology and Society,2005,"Given escalating concern worldwide about the loss of biodiversity, and given biodiversity�s centrality to quality of life, it is imperative that current ecological knowledge fully informs societal decision making. Over the past two decades, ecological science has undergone many significant shifts in emphasis and perspective, which have important implications for how we manage ecosystems and species. In particular, a shift has occurred from the equilibrium paradigm to one that recognizes the dynamic, non- equilibrium nature of ecosystems. Revised thinking about the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological systems has important implications for management. Thus, it is of growing concern to ecologists and others that these recent developments have not been translated into information useful to managers and policy makers. Many conservation policies and plans are still based on equilibrium assumptions. A fundamental difficulty with integrating current ecological thinking into biodiversity policy and management planning is that field observations have yet to provide compelling evidence for many of the relationships suggested by non-equilibrium ecology. Yet despite this scientific uncertainty, management and policy decisions must still be made. This paper was motivated by the need for considered scientific debate on the significance of current ideas in theoretical ecology for biodiversity conservation. This paper aims to provide a platform for such discussion by presenting a critical synthesis of recent ecological literature that (1) identifies core issues in ecological theory, and (2) explores the implications of current ecological thinking for biodiversity conservation.

Conservation of the critically endangered saiga antelope in the Republic of Kalmykia (Russia) provides a unique experimental set-up that was used to disentangle this issue. This study uses the amount pledged for conservation, adapted from contingent valuation methods, as a measure of behavioural intention to contribute to saiga conservation, to evaluate conservation effectiveness. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 250 individuals in eight villages exposed to traditional �fences-and- fines� conservation, livelihoods enhancement (social engagement) or low-level media coverage. The intervention employed had a direct effect on amount pledged for saiga conservation. Social engagement programmes decreased protest-bidding behaviour but resulted in low amounts pledged for saiga conservation. Those exposed to media coverage pledged the greatest amounts on average, whilst those exposed to traditional conservation had both a high level of protest bidding and low pledges from those who pledged something. The primary reason given for protest bids was that the government or international community should pay for conservation. This may be a relic from the Soviet era, and may explain low pledges for conservation under social engagement. Ecological knowledge strongly affected amount pledged. The results were influenced by cultural and demographic factors, including residence time, exposure to saigas, age, wealth and knowledge regarding conservation. This study is unusual in disentangling the effect of a conservation intervention from other factors, and proposes using amount pledged for conservation as a practical tool for evaluating the effectiveness of projects aimed at increasing awareness and promoting positive behavioural intentions towards conservation.
